## Overview
### Description
[Description of your app]

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking / Gaming
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** an App that can be a platform for Gamers to find people to play with. You would basically be able to create an account, set up your profile and game preferences, and then be able to find like-minded gamers to play with. It can be either with Practice in mind (like if youâ€™re a competitive player), or with forming a team in mind (like if you have Esports aspirations), or even with casual gamers in mind (like if you want to find someone to play a co-op game with)
- **Market:**
- **Habit:**
- **Scope:**

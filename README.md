## Overview
### Description
Union is an app that serves as an alternative way of finding people to play with. As awesome as platforms such as Discord and Reddit are for finding communities in the games that we love and play, sometimes these servers and reddit forums can set out to do multiple things at once. If you have ever joined a community on one of these platforms, you will see that often times they are littered with off-topic  channels and are very multi-purpose. This can be a pain-point if your primary intention for joining in the first place is for LFG (Looking for Group). Union serves to eliminate this pain-point by having our platform prioritize the games and the people who play them.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Social Networking / Gaming
- **Mobile:** Union will be developed with a "mobile-first" mindset, but absolutely has room for expansion outside of just your mobile devices.
- **Story:** Union will serve as a platform for Gamers to find people to play and connect with. It can be with practice in mind (if youâ€™re a competitive player), with forming a team in mind (if you have Esports aspirations), or even with casual-play in mind (if you seek someone for a cooperative experience).
- **Market:** According to eMarketer at InsiderIntelligence, the number of Digital Gamers will reach over 179 million this year in the US alone. Union is marketable to every single one of those people. The reason being is because Union serves as an alternative way of finding Gamers to connect with, regardless of whether you're considered a "hard-core" Gamer or not.
- **Habit:** Simply put, if you love gaming, you'll love Union. The usage our users get out of our app will be determined by how integral gaming is to their lives. If gaming is something someone does and talks about daily, then they have the potential to open up our app daily as well.
- **Scope:** Union will serve as an app that's used to connect users based on interests and game preferences. Outside the scope of bringing Gamers together to play, the app has the potential to also serve as a place of information gathering; becoming a resource for current events in the space of video-games (tailored to the users preferences).
